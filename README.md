# OLIDARA Savings

## Overview
Nigeria has made significant strides in financial inclusion, with the rate of financial exclusion decreasing from 32% in 2020 to 26% in 2023. This progress is a testament to the efforts aligned with the Nigeria Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS 3.0), which aims to reduce financial exclusion to 25% by 2024. Despite this improvement, challenges remain, particularly for petty traders, small-scale entrepreneurs, farmers, and artisans in both rural and urban areas.

## Challenges of Traditional Olidara Systems
The traditional Olidara savings scheme, while popular, presents several issues:
- High Risk of Cash Handling: The reliance on cash increases the risk of robberies, fraud, and other cash-related crimes.
- Manual Saving Schemes: The prevalence of manual processes leads to inefficiencies and errors.
- Excessive Paperwork: The dependence on paper documents can result in data loss and inaccuracies.
- Vulnerability to Disasters: Financial loss due to incidents such as fire and flooding is a significant concern.
- Operational Inefficiency: Time and effort are often wasted due to outdated methods of managing finances.
